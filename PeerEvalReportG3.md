# 💛✨💘 Peer Evaluation & Presentation Review for Group 3 (0619, by MK316)

+ Group 3, your presentation was a resounding success, showcasing a well-rounded approach to multimodal learning that effectively engaged and supported the students. Your use of AI videos, QR codes, and a variety of apps tailored to enhance both listening and reading skills is commendable. The high scores in "Support," "Accessibility," and "Adaptability" demonstrate your group’s ability to address diverse learning needs and provide multiple entry points to the content, which is crucial for inclusive education.
+ The integration of AI to create visual and auditory narratives of the story not only maintained engagement among lower-level students but also helped them grasp complex concepts through simplified visuals and clear instructions. The vocabulary builder app was highlighted as particularly effective, helping students focus on key terms essential for understanding the story.

+ However, there are opportunities for refinement to maximize the effectiveness of your methods. Considering the use of British English in the flashcard app, it's important to ensure consistency with the type of English used throughout the course, unless a specific variety is part of the learning objectives. Moreover, the suggestion to merge the "guess the story with images" activity with the during-listening task could streamline the lesson and reinforce the story's structure, aiding comprehension before moving into more detailed comprehension tasks.

+ The pacing and density of activities were noted; while ambitious, it's crucial to balance the complexity and number of tasks to avoid overwhelming the students. Simplifying some activities or allowing more time for others might enhance focus and learning outcomes.

+ Your presentation's strengths in "Stimulation", "Accessibility" and "Presentation" were clear, reflecting your group's skill in creating an inviting and dynamic learning environment. However, implementing feedback mechanisms that include anonymous options could further lower students' affective filters, encouraging more honest and constructive responses.

+ In closing, your innovative use of technology in education serves as an inspiration. Keep refining your approach based on feedback and classroom dynamics. The thoughtful adjustments you make now can lead to even more successful implementations in the future. Well done, Group 3! Keep up the excellent work and continue to explore how technology can make learning more accessible and engaging for all students.

|1|Again, I love the use of QR codes! I love the pre-listening phase as I think it does a good job of engaging the students and motivating them to want to hear the story. I like that you had a good variety of app use. I think it was a great idea to also include links to the apps in the powerpoint. The created AI video of the story was great to keep lower-level students engaged and to lower their affective filter as they may be less overwhelmed with the visual aspect. I love that the listening activity is broken into parts and can be broken down further even sentence by sentence for students who need it.|
|2|Nothing|
|3|Ice breaker|
|4|The way of writing and then reading it aloud is a great idea!:)|
|5|AI 이미지를 사용해서 이야기 순서를 유추해보고, 또 이를 사용한 비디오를 통해 listening&reading이 함께되는 부분이 좋았다.|
|6|"Vocabulary builder app was super good!!|
|7|It helped Ss build the vocab with some key words that are important for understanding the story."|
|8|Ai video is fantastic. T's instruction was so clear and the lesson design is well structured.|
|9|The video was engaging! Every app was well-organized and meaningful. Well done!|
|10|인비디오로 재미있게 이야기를 만들어서 보여준것이 인상적이었습니다. 레벨이 낮은 학생들의 이목을 집중시키기에 좋았습니다. 또한 다른 어플들도 유용했습니다.|
|11|디지털 수업임에도 선생님과 학생의 활발한 상호작용|
|12|Making AI video for listening text was a great idea. It could scaffold to understand the story for the lower level students.|
|13|Especially, I liked Engagement, Integration, Accessibility of Group 3.|
|14|By using various tools, learners learn English with no pressure.|

|1|Is there a recent you chose British English as the voice for the flashcard app? In regards to the during listening, I actually think this could be combined with the "guess the story with images" activity. That modified activity would be more beneficial after a first listening or after the video listening. This is especially helpful for your intermediate-low students as it can't hurt to listen one more time. This would function as a general listening task before the comprehension activity which might be beneficial scaffolding that allows them to listen to the story one more time. Will students submit their feedback anonymously for lower affective filter? Some further modeling from the teacher or prompts for this activity might be helpful for the students' level but the Padlet looks great!!!!|
|2|Nothing|
|3|Seems fine|
|4|Explaining the function of apps more.|
|5|"안그래도 발음은 학생들이 가장 꺼려하는 부분인데 점수를 전체적으로 공개하고 발음파일을 공유하는 점은 좋은 아이디어는 아닌거 같다."|
|6|Nothing. They were perfect! :)|
|7|Sequencing activity , It would better with more clues for scaffolding.|
|8|It looks like a very packed lesson. I know you guys put lots of efforts! But in reality, maybe narrowing down some elements in one lesson can be considered.|
|9|완전한 문장을 볼 기회가 생각보다 적었습니다. 비록 영상에서 완전한 문장이 제시되기는 하지만 긴호흡으로 글을 읽을 기회가 적었던것 같습니다.|
|10|활동의 뚜렷한 목적성 필요|
|11|For the image ordering activity, the number of images were many, so the workload would be big for the students. I think it would be better to reduce the number of the images or students can do this activity with their partner collaboratively.|
|12|They would have been quite stressful as they were the last turn to finish the presentations, but everything seemed to work well. Nice work, all of you!:)|
|13|They were doing good!!|
