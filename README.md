## Lesson Structure & Activities
### [Pre-reading activities (15 mins.)]
**üëä Icebreaking with the Topic (3 mins.)**

**Activity:** Ss share their experiences and thoughts related to the topic introduced by T After looking at the topic-related images.
**App Functionality:** The app displays the four images from [Visual Material #1] and allows Ss to annotate or add comments to each image. Ss can tap on an image and make a short comment about their thoughts and experiences related to that image.
**Objective:** Encourage Ss to connect personally with the topic through visual material and facilitate a quick, engaging discussion that sets the stage for the story.

**üî§ Building Vocabulary (7 mins.)**

**Activity:** Ss interact with an app to learn and practice key vocabulary related to the story through flashcards.
**App Functionality:** The [App #1] app displays digital flashcards on the interactive whiteboard so that Ss can also have a closer look on their tablets.
**Objective:** Introduce and practice key vocabulary related to the story, enhancing Ss' vocabulary knowledge.

**üé∞ Guessing the Story with Images (5 mins.)**

**Activity:** Ss guess the story with the images related to the story. 
**App Functionality:** The [App #2] app displays three WordCloud images of the Intro, Body, and Conclusion and 6 random story images. Ss use their tablets to guess and discuss the story with peers and unscramble the random images in the right order after looking at the WordCloud images.
**Objective:** Encourage Ss to predict the story and develop inferencing skills.


### [During-reading activities (25 mins.)]
**üíª Introduced the Story with a Video (5 mins.)** 

**Activity:** Ss watch a teacher-created video of the full story, taking notes and paying attention to the main characters, settings, and events.
**App Functionality:** The video of [Visual Material #2] is played on the interactive whiteboard, and Ss can access the video on their tablets for closer viewing.
**Objective:** Provide an overview and introduce the story through visual and auditory learning.

**üîàUnderstanding the Story with Audio (10 mins.)**

**Activity:** Ss listen to the story in segments and answer the questions provided by T to enhance comprehension of the plot and main elements.
**App Functionality:** The app plays audio of [Audio Material #1] by T, playing segments of the story in class, and a QR code is provided to Ss to access on their tablets.
**Objective:** Focus on listening skills and detailed comprehension, identifying key story elements.

**üìù Checking Reading Comprehension (10 mins.)** 

**Activity:** Ss answer multiple-choice, true/false, short answer, and vocabulary questions related to the story.
**App Functionality:** The app presents comprehension questions that Ss can answer on their tablets, providing immediate feedback.
**Objective:** Enhance reading comprehension skills and promote critical thinking and vocabulary development.



### [Post-reading activity (10 mins.)]
**üëÑ [Thinking Critically & Evaluating] (10 mins.)**

**Activity:** Ss write responses to critical questions, record their answers, and practice speaking skills through self-assessment. 
**App Functionality:** The app has Ss write in English to respond to the question, record their responses, and play them back for self-evaluation.
**Objective:** Enhance English proficiency by responding to critical questions, recording responses, and self-assessing speaking abilities.

## Homework Assignment (Critical Thinking & Peer Feedback)

**üîà&üëÑ[Thinking Critically & Providing Peer Feedback]**

**Activity:** Ss listen to three recordings uploaded by classmates on the Padlet board titled "Upload your recording # 1" and choose one response to give feedback. They then record and upload their verbal feedback on the board titled "[HW] Upload your recording #2 (Peer Feedback)". 
**App Functionality:** The [App #4] app is used to record the feedback, the same as the process of the Post-reading activity. Ss upload their feedback to the Padlet board.
**Objective:** Enhance evaluative and communication skills by providing constructive feedback to peers.


## [Rationale]
**[Pre-reading Activities]**
Pre-reading activities are crucial for schema activation, which helps students connect new information to their existing knowledge base. Icebreaking fosters a low-anxiety environment (Krashen, 1982), promoting a positive affective filter that facilitates language acquisition. Vocabulary exercises enhance lexical competence (Nation, 2001), aiding in better comprehension and retention of key terms. Predicting the story through images engages students in inferencing, a critical thinking skill that promotes deeper cognitive processing and engagement (Harmer, 2007).

**[During-reading Activities]**
During-reading activities ensure active engagement and foster deeper interaction with the text (Brown, 2004). Utilizing multimedia resources aligns with the dual coding theory (Paivio, 1986), which posits that combining verbal and visual information enhances memory and learning. These activities cater to diverse learning styles, making the content more accessible and engaging. Immediate feedback provided during comprehension questions supports Vygotsky‚Äôs (1978) concept of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), allowing students to receive timely scaffolding that reinforces learning and corrects misunderstandings.

**[Post-reading Activities]**
Post-reading activities and homework assignments reinforce learning by encouraging students to apply their knowledge critically and reflectively. Engaging in critical thinking and self-evaluation promotes metacognitive awareness, which is essential for self-regulated learning (Flavell, 1979). Peer feedback activities are grounded in social constructivism (Vygotsky, 1978), as they foster a collaborative learning environment where students construct knowledge through social interaction. This process helps develop evaluative and communication skills, essential for language proficiency and overall academic success.

**<Synopsis>**
In a quaint village surrounded by rolling hills, young Tom struggled with the tough soil in his family's garden. One day, a peddler arrived selling various items, including magical seeds. Tom purchased a packet and planted them in his garden. To everyone's surprise, the seeds grew into vibrant and lush plants, transforming the barren garden into a wonder. The remarkable growth of these plants brought the community together, with neighbors sharing seeds and gardening tips. Inspired by the peddler, Tom later became a peddler himself, spreading joy and community spirit by selling magic seeds to other villages. Tom's story became a symbol of how small acts of kindness and curiosity can lead to widespread beauty and unity.
