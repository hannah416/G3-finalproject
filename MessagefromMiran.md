## Speaking practice Application

+ [App link](https://mk-316-speechfeedback.hf.space/): In this application, the user can type or paste his own text, and then record his reading. The feedback has three parts (1) WER (Word Error Rate), (2) Number of pauses, (3) WPM (Words per minute) = speech rate. Teacher needs to understand how much pauses are okay for the give text. Otherwise this information can be confusing to students. (If you want to have an app code without giving WER, Pause as feedback, let me know. I'll modify the code and share it with you) => Please email me to remind this (mirankim316@gmail.com).
  + Students can practice speaking (e.g., to share the message with peer students) by recording and getting feedback.  
  + However, I think if this application has an option to convert the text to speech, this may help students more. (I'll try it out, and share the code with you if I succeed.)
