## Speaking practice Application

### 10PM, 0604
+ [App link](https://mk-316-speechfeedback.hf.space/): In this application, the user can type or paste his own text, and then record his reading. The feedback has three parts (1) WER (Word Error Rate), (2) Number of pauses, (3) WPM (Words per minute) = speech rate.
  + Students can practice speaking (e.g., to share the message with peer students) by recording and getting feedback.  
  + However, I think if this application has an option to convert the text to speech, this may help students more. (I'll try it out, and share the code with you if I succeed.)
